# ccf-pilot-backend


pretty straightforward, in JS, express server, my local versions originally had several server files, for different stages, but only the latest and most relevant one is here.

The server is just a series of endpoints that stream the response back to the frontend, as "Compose" concurrently triggers each endpoint from the frontend. We are no longer using the Keywords endpoint,
but I didnt want to delete it at short notice on Friday, in case something went wrong.
